# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction  
**Week 1 Milestone | AICTE–Edunet Internship**

This repository contains the work done for **Week 1** of the Carbon Emission Prediction project under the AICTE–Edunet Internship.  
Edunet–Shell Skills4Future AICTE internship focused on Green skills & AI.

The focus for this milestone was on data cleaning and preparation of the raw climate dataset.

## 🔧 Improvisations Done (by Vani Sai Deepika)

As part of the Week 1 assignment, I have implemented the following changes:

- ✅ Created a safe copy of the dataset using `.copy()` to avoid altering the original data  
- ✅ Replaced missing values like `''` and `'..'` with `np.nan`  
- ✅ Used `.applymap()` to convert numeric-looking strings to actual numbers while skipping text columns  
- ✅ Dropped columns with excessive missing values to clean the dataset  
- ✅ Structured the Jupyter notebook using markdown headings for each step  
- ✅ Added detailed comments explaining the purpose of each block  
- ✅ Exported the final cleaned dataset as `data_cleaned.csv` for future model development
