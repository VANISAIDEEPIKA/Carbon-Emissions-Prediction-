# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction  
**Week 1 Milestone | AICTE–Edunet Internship**

This repository contains the work done for **Week 1** of the Carbon Emission Prediction project under the AICTE–Edunet Internship.  
Edunet–Shell Skills4Future AICTE internship focused on Green skills & AI.

The focus for this milestone was on data cleaning and preparation of the raw climate dataset.

## 🔧 Improvisations Done (by Vani Sai Deepika)

As part of the Week 1 assignment, I have implemented the following changes:

- I created a copy of the original dataset using `.copy()` so that the raw data stays untouched  
- Replaced missing values like `''` and `'..'` with `np.nan` to make the data consistent  
- Used `.applymap()` to safely convert values to numbers without affecting text columns  
- Removed columns that had too many missing values to keep the dataset clean  
- Added markdown headings in the notebook to separate each step clearly  
- Wrote simple comments to explain what each block of code is doing
